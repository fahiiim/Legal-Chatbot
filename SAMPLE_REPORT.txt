LEGAL ANALYSIS & FINDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CRIMINAL LIABILITY ANALYSIS: ARSON

Based on the facts presented, the individuals who intentionally spread kerosene and burned your neighbor's house may face charges under Michigan's arson statute, specifically MCL 750.71 (Burning of Dwelling House).

APPLICABLE STATUTORY ELEMENTS:

Under Michigan Criminal Jury Instruction 31.15 (Burning of a Dwelling House), the prosecutor must prove the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt:

1. BURNING OF PROPERTY
   Definition: "Burning" means setting fire to or doing anything that results in the starting of a fire, or helping or persuading someone else to set a fire.
   Standard: It is sufficient if any part of the property is burned, no matter how small; the property does not have to be completely destroyed.
   Application to Your Case: The spreading of kerosene and subsequent fire clearly satisfies this element.

2. NATURE OF THE PROPERTY (Dwelling House)
   Definition: A dwelling house is a structure that was actually being lived in or reasonably could have been lived in at the time of the fire.
   Vacant Dwelling Exception: The fact that your neighbors were on vacation does not necessarily prevent this from being charged as burning of a dwelling house, as the house remained a residential dwelling.
   Application to Your Case: As a residential property, this element appears satisfied.

3. INTENT REQUIREMENT
   Definition: When the defendant burned the dwelling or any of its contents, they must have intended to burn the dwelling or contents, OR intentionally committed an act creating a very high risk of burning the dwelling or contents, with knowledge of that risk and disregard for it.
   Application to Your Case: The deliberate spreading of kerosene indicates clear intent to burn the property.

EVIDENCE CONSIDERATIONS:

Your CCTV footage is CRITICAL evidence that:
- Establishes the defendants' intentional actions
- Creates a timeline of events
- Provides direct visual proof of malicious conduct
- Corroborates witness testimony
- May establish premeditation or planning

EVIDENTIARY CHAIN:
1. Preserve all CCTV footage in original and backup formats
2. Document the date, time stamps, and quality of video
3. Identify the defendants clearly in footage
4. Note any other witnesses present
5. Photograph damage to the property

POTENTIAL CRIMINAL CHARGES:

PRIMARY:
- MCL 750.71: Burning of a Dwelling House (Felony - up to life imprisonment)

SECONDARY/ALTERNATIVE:
- MCL 750.72: Burning of Other Buildings/Property (if charged as building other than dwelling)
- MCL 750.539: Willful/Malicious Destruction of Property
- MCL 750.110: Conspiracy (if coordinated between both defendants)
- MCL 750.349: Arson Causing Bodily Injury (if anyone was injured)

AGGRAVATING FACTORS:
- Premeditation (bringing accelerant)
- Multiple perpetrators (conspiracy)
- Potential for life safety issues
- Property destruction causing financial loss

CIVIL LIABILITY CONSIDERATIONS:

Beyond criminal charges, your neighbors may have civil remedies:
- Premises liability claim against any responsible parties
- Negligent/intentional tort damages
- Insurance recovery (homeowner's policy)
- Restitution through criminal proceedings

YOUR ROLE AS WITNESS & COMPLAINANT:

As the reporting party with critical evidence:
1. You will likely be a key witness in any prosecution
2. Maintain detailed records of when/how you obtained video
3. Secure the original footage (avoid compression or editing)
4. Be prepared for potential witness intimidation (report to police if occurs)
5. Coordinate with police investigation and prosecutor's office

NEXT STEPS:

IMMEDIATE (24-48 hours):
1. Report the incident to local law enforcement (911 if not already done)
2. File a written police report
3. Provide all CCTV footage and technical details
4. Identify any other witnesses

SHORT-TERM (1-2 weeks):
1. Consult with a criminal defense or prosecution victim advocate
2. Obtain a police report number for insurance and civil claims
3. Assist in identifying the defendants
4. Prepare for police interview/formal statement

MEDIUM-TERM (ongoing):
1. Respond to any law enforcement requests
2. Support prosecution investigation
3. Prepare for potential grand jury testimony
4. Coordinate with neighbors on their insurance claims
